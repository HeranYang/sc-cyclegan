# Note:
## 1. There are many settings in main.py that needs to be changed according to your applications. Besides, it contains three modes, respectively train, validation and test.
## 2. The experiments are performed on Junghoon's data, where 27 subjects are used for training, 3 subjects for validation and 15 for test.
